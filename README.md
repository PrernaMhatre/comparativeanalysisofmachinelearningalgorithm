# Comparative Analysis of Machine Learning Algorithm on different dataset
In this project I have used Python and different machine learning algorithms on three different datasets of same domain that is bank.

## 1. Objective <a id=section1></a>

In this project,I attempted to cover a number of machine
learning strategies in datasets that address reality with
problems and potential solutions, as well as evaluate their
efficiancy using measurement criteria that are both practical
and adaptable to future projects. In this project, there are three different questions or targets which are solved using the ML models.

1. To predict the credit score of the customer using
machine learning technique?
2. The classification goal of this dataset is to predict
whether the client will subscribe term deposit or not?
3. To predict whether the client will do the payment of
credit card or not?

To run this project you have to following libraries provided in section 2.

## 2. Importing Packages  <a id=section2></a>

For comparative analysis the all three dataset are used from the same domain that is Bank domain. And the datasets are finance banking prediction, bank marketing dataset, and the last is Default of credit card client dataset. Initially all the dataset are being preprocessed and then the algorithms are applied.

To run this project you have to follow following steps,

1. Clone the repository (git clone "repository name"),
2. Install python,
3. Install Anaconda Navigator,
4. Then execute the code,
